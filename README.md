# DESIGN
## Wireframes
Prior to commencing the coding process, comprehensive wireframes were produced for each section of the quiz  using Figma - a design tool used for creating user interfaces, prototypes, and wireframes. These wireframes served as the initial blueprints, providing a visual roadmap for the quiz layout and structure on both desktop and mobile devices.

It's important to note that while the final product evolved from these early plans, some deviations were intentionally made to enhance the user experience and align better with the project's goals.

This iterative process allowed for flexibility in adapting to evolving project requirements, ultimately contributing to the development of a more refined and user-friendly quiz.

## Imagery
The imagery chosen for this quiz is purposeful and aims to enhance the overall user experience. Each background image used throughout the quiz has been carefully selected to complement the theme and narrative of the quiz.

As the user progresses through the quiz, the background imagery dynamically changes with a fadeIn/fadeOut transition effect. This deliberate design choice aims to immerse the user in the experience, creating a sense of progression akin to turning the pages of a graphical novel.

The changing background imagery not only adds visual interest but also helps to convey the evolving storyline and atmosphere of the quiz. By seamlessly integrating visual elements with the quiz content, the goal is to enhance user engagement and create a memorable and immersive experience for every participant.

## Colours
The colour scheme used in this quiz is purposefully minimalistic, aiming to evoke the dark and gritty ambiance of Gotham City. Drawing inspiration from the iconic setting, the colour palette revolves around bold and striking hues, accentuated by hover effects to highlight key elements of the page.

At the outset of the quiz, a vibrant yellow colour takes center stage in the the interface, setting the stage for the user's journey. As the quiz progresses, the colour dynamically shifts to either red or blue, reflecting the path chosen by the user – hero or villain, respectively. This intentional use of colour not only enhances the visual narrative but also provides a subtle indication of the user's progress and choices throughout the quiz.

Consistency is maintained in the choice of font colours, with a white font against dark-coloured backgrounds ensuring optimal readability and visual contrast. By employing a minimalist colour scheme and hover effects, the goal is to immerse participants in the immersive world of the quiz while maintaining clarity and ease of navigation.

## Fonts
In this quiz project, typography plays a crucial role in enhancing visual appeal and ensuring readability across all content. Consistently, the 'Judson' font is employed for both headings and paragraph text, offering a balanced and cohesive aesthetic throughout the interface.

For headings, 'Judson' imparts a sense of elegance and sophistication, elevating the presentation of key information. Meanwhile, paragraph text is set in 'Judson' as well, ensuring a comfortable reading experience for users across all sections.

To maintain consistency and legibility, a Sans Serif font serves as the backup option. This ensures that even if the primary font isn't loaded correctly, the text remains clear and easily readable.

This consistency provides a seamless and visually pleasing experience for users.

## Accessibility
Accessibility is a key consideration in the design of this quiz project, ensuring that all users, regardless of ability, can fully engage with the content.

Colour Contrast: The chosen colour scheme offers a strong contrast, enhancing readability and ensuring that text and content are easily distinguishable against the background. This deliberate choice promotes a visually accessible experience for all users.

Font Selection: Prioritising simplicity and readability, clear and straightforward fonts have been selected. This ensures that the content remains legible for users with varying visual abilities, contributing to an inclusive user experience.

Background Images: Background images are purely decorative and serve no functional purpose within the quiz. Removing them would not affect the meaning or functionality of the quiz, thus maintaining accessibility for all users.

Icons: Icons are used as links to relevant information or interactive elements within the quiz. To ensure accessibility, each icon is accompanied by an aria-label attribute providing additional information for users employing screen readers. This facilitates seamless navigation and interaction for all users, promoting inclusivity throughout the quiz experience.

## Future Enhancements
**Dynamic Quiz Expansion:** One of the key areas for improvement in the project is to enhance the dynamic nature of the quiz.

Additionally, incorporating animations or visual cues during transitions can further enhance the storytelling aspect of the quiz.

**Accessibility and Usability Features:** Implementing accessibility and usability features can make the quiz more inclusive and user-friendly. This may involve optimising the quiz interface for screen readers, ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies, and incorporating features such as keyboard navigation and adjustable font sizes to accommodate users with additional needs.

**Refined Tiebreaker Mechanism:** To enhance the user experience and provide a more definitive outcome, the current random selection method in the event of a tiebreaker can be improved. Instead of randomly selecting a character from the top scorers, the quiz could introduce bonus questions that continue until a clear highest-scoring character emerges. This approach ensures that the users final character alignment is the result of their choices, adding depth and personalisation to the quiz results.

# BUGS
## Fixed Bugs

### Incorrect Access of Answer Personality Types

**Issue:** Selecting an answer in the first question incorrectly triggered both hero and villain paths.

**Solution:** Modified the `showFirstQuestion` function and utilised jQuery's `.data()` method to ensure the correct personality type is associated with each answer button.

**Outcome:** The quiz now correctly progresses based on the user's selected personality type, eliminating the previous incorrect behaviour.

### Hover Effect Persisting on Mobile Devices

**Issue:** Hover effect on answer buttons remained active on mobile devices after selection and progressing to the next question, causing confusion.

**Solution:** Updated CSS with media queries to remove the hover effect on mobile devices once an answer is selected.

**Outcome:** Hover effects on mobile devices are now cleared after answer selection, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience.

### Persistent Hover Effect on Touchscreen Devices

**Issue:** Despite implementing the solution above (Hover Effect Persisting on Mobile Devices), it was noted that hover effects intended for cursor-based interactions were persisting on some touchscreen devices, causing user interface inconsistencies and confusion.

**Solution:** Implemented CSS media queries to detect devices that do not support hover functionality. Within these queries, the hover styles were overridden to prevent persistent hover states on touchscreen devices.

**Source:**
The solution was adapted from a discussion on a Stack Overflow forum about using media queries to detect if a device is touchscreen ("Media Query to Detect if device is touchsreen).

**Outcome:** After implementing the media queries, the hover effects no longer persist on touchscreen devices, enhancing the user experience by ensuring the user interface behaves consistently across various devices.

**Test Result:** PASS

## Automated Testing
Automated testing was undertaken using a range of open-source developer tools including Google Lighthouse Analysis, HTML, CSS and JavaScript validation. These tests assessed the quiz's quality, performance, accessibility and adherence to web standards. Any identified issues were addressed to enhance the websites usability and overall user experience.  

### HTML
To test the markup validity [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to assess markup validity and compliance with accessibility standards.
The following warning/errors were identified and addressed:

**Possible Misuse of Aria-label:** The aria-label attribute was originally attached to a div element, which is not considered an interactive element and therefore cannot have aria-label attributes.

To resolve this issue and ensure compliance with accessibility standards, the div element was replaced with a button element. Buttons are interactive elements and are suitable for adding aria-label attributes.

By making this adjustment, the HTML code now adheres to accessibility guidelines and passes validation without errors.

**Empty h1 and p Tags Detected:** Some h1 and p tags were found to be empty in the HTML code. This could potentially impact accessibility, as h1 tags are typically used to define the main heading of a page, providing important context to both users and search engines.

To address this issue, placeholder text has been added within the empty tags to ensure that they are not empty. Additionally, the method of dynamically adding content to these h1 tags has been revised. Instead of using the .append method in jQuery, the .text method is now employed to replace the placeholder text with the desired content.

By implementing these changes, the HTML code now maintains proper semantic structure, enhancing accessibility and ensuring compliance with web standards.

**Empty Image Tag Detected:** An empty image tag without a specified source (src) attribute was identified in the HTML code. This can lead to broken image links and affect the visual presentation of the website.

To resolve this issue, a placeholder image has been inserted into the src attribute of the empty image tag. Additionally, the jQuery code responsible for dynamically updating the image source has been modified to use the .text method instead of the .append. This ensures that the src attribute is properly set to the desired image source.

By making these adjustments, the HTML code now includes a valid image source, preventing broken image links and improving the overall user experience. Additionally, the revised jQuery code ensures accurate manipulation of the image source attribute, maintaining consistency and reliability in the dynamic content updates.

### CSS
A [CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to check the validity of the CSS code of the quiz. There were no errors detected.

### JavaScript
A [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check the validity of the JavaScript code of the quiz. Any identified errors were addressed.
