# LOGIC OVERVIEW
The Gotham's Dark Decision quiz is a JavaScript-powered frontend website designed to immerse users in the captivating world of Batman. However, to ensure accessibility and comprehension for a broader audience, the code has been translated into plain English. This transparency provides users with insight into the application's functionality and structure without requiring programming knowledge, fostering trust and engagement.

# DESIGN

## Wireframes
Prior to commencing the coding process, comprehensive wireframes were produced for each section of the quiz  using Figma - a design tool used for creating user interfaces, prototypes, and wireframes. These wireframes served as the initial blueprints, providing a visual roadmap for the quiz layout and structure on both desktop and mobile devices.

It's important to note that while the final product evolved from these early plans, some deviations were intentionally made to enhance the user experience and align better with the project's goals.

This iterative process allowed for flexibility in adapting to evolving project requirements, ultimately contributing to the development of a more refined and user-friendly quiz.

## Imagery
The imagery chosen for this quiz is purposeful and aims to enhance the overall user experience. Each background image used throughout the quiz has been carefully selected to complement the theme and narrative of the quiz.

As the user progresses through the quiz, the background imagery dynamically changes with a fadeIn/fadeOut transition effect. This deliberate design choice aims to immerse the user in the experience, creating a sense of progression akin to turning the pages of a graphical novel.

The changing background imagery not only adds visual interest but also helps to convey the evolving storyline and atmosphere of the quiz. By seamlessly integrating visual elements with the quiz content, the goal is to enhance user engagement and create a memorable and immersive experience for every participant.

## Colours
The colour scheme used in this quiz is purposefully minimalistic, aiming to evoke the dark and gritty ambiance of Gotham City. Drawing inspiration from the iconic setting, the colour palette revolves around bold and striking hues, accentuated by hover effects to highlight key elements of the page.

At the outset of the quiz, a vibrant yellow colour takes center stage in the the interface, setting the stage for the user's journey. As the quiz progresses, the colour dynamically shifts to either red or blue, reflecting the path chosen by the user – hero or villain, respectively. This intentional use of colour not only enhances the visual narrative but also provides a subtle indication of the user's progress and choices throughout the quiz.

Consistency is maintained in the choice of font colours, with a white font against dark-coloured backgrounds ensuring optimal readability and visual contrast. By employing a minimalist colour scheme and hover effects, the goal is to immerse participants in the immersive world of the quiz while maintaining clarity and ease of navigation.

## Fonts
In this quiz project, typography plays a crucial role in enhancing visual appeal and ensuring readability across all content. Consistently, the 'Judson' font is employed for both headings and paragraph text, offering a balanced and cohesive aesthetic throughout the interface.

For headings, 'Judson' imparts a sense of elegance and sophistication, elevating the presentation of key information. Meanwhile, paragraph text is set in 'Judson' as well, ensuring a comfortable reading experience for users across all sections.

To maintain consistency and legibility, a Sans Serif font serves as the backup option. This ensures that even if the primary font isn't loaded correctly, the text remains clear and easily readable.

This consistency provides a seamless and visually pleasing experience for users.


## Accessibility
Accessibility is a key consideration in the design of this quiz project, ensuring that all users, regardless of ability, can fully engage with the content.

Colour Contrast: The chosen colour scheme offers a strong contrast, enhancing readability and ensuring that text and content are easily distinguishable against the background. This deliberate choice promotes a visually accessible experience for all users.

Font Selection: Prioritizing simplicity and readability, clear and straightforward fonts have been selected. This ensures that the content remains legible for users with varying visual abilities, contributing to an inclusive user experience.

Background Images: Background images are purely decorative and serve no functional purpose within the quiz. Removing them would not affect the meaning or functionality of the quiz, thus maintaining accessibility for all users.

Icons: Icons are used as links to relevant information or interactive elements within the quiz. To ensure accessibility, each icon is accompanied by an aria-label attribute providing additional information for users employing screen readers. This facilitates seamless navigation and interaction for all users, promoting inclusivity throughout the quiz experience.

Each object can represent a question, containing properties such as the question itself, answer options, and other relevant data. When the user makes a choice, it can filter this array to display the appropriate questions based on their path (hero or villain).


# BUGS

## Fixed Bugs
### Title: Incorrect Access of Answer Personality Types

#### Issue:
When clicking on an answer button in the first question of the quiz, both hero and villain personality types are being accessed, resulting in incorrect behaviour and progression through the quiz.

#### Description:
During testing of the quiz functionality, it was observed that clicking on an answer button in the first question did not accurately reflect the selected personality type (Hero or villain). Instead of distinguishing between hero and villain personalities, both types were being accessed simultaneously.

#### Expected Behavior:
When clicking on an answer button, only the corresponding personality type (hero or villain) should be accessed and used to determine the next steps in the quiz. This ensures that the quiz accurately reflects the user's choices and progresses accordingly.

#### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access the quiz application.
2. Start the quiz.
3. Click on an answer button for a question that presents hero or villain personality options.
4. Note that both hero and villain paths are triggered simultaneously.

#### Investigation and Solution:
1. Reviewed the `showFirstQuestion` function responsible for displaying the hero or villain branch question of the quiz quiz.
2. Added jQuery's .data() method to attach the data property "personality" from the array to the button element. 
3. Addeed '$(this).data("personality") to the event listenter  to retreive the value property "personality" from the specfic button element that was clicked and store it in the personality variable to be used in the if/else statement.
4. Tested the modified code using console.log toto verify that only the correct personality type is accessed, resolving the issue of incorrect quiz progression.

#### Result:
The bug related to the incorrect access of answer personality types has been fixed. Now, when clicking an answer button in the first question, only the corresponding hero or villain personality type is accessed, ensuring accurate quiz progression based on user choices.

### Title: Hover Effect Persisting on Mobile Devices

#### Issue:
Hover effect on answer buttons persists on mobile devices, leading to an inconsistent user experience.

#### Description:
During testing of the quiz application on mobile devices, it was observed that after selecting an answer and progressing to the next question, the last selected answer button maintained its hover appearance. This behavior was inconsistent with the expected behavior and caused confusion among users.

#### Expected Behavior:
On mobile devices, the hover effect should not persist after an answer button is selected and the user progresses to the next question. This ensures a consistent and intuitive user experience across different devices.

#### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access the quiz application on a mobile device.
2. Start the quiz.
3. Select an answer by tapping an answer button.
4. Progress to the next question.
5. Note that the last selected answer button maintains its hover appearance.

#### Investigation and Solution:
1. Reviewed the CSS styles for answer buttons to identify the source of the hover effect.
2. Added media queries to the CSS file targeting smaller devices (e.g., mobile devices).
3. Within the media queries, removed the hover effect for answer buttons to ensure it doesn't persist on mobile devices.
4. Tested the modified CSS on various mobile devices to verify that the hover effect no longer persists after selecting an answer.

#### Result:
The issue related to the hover effect persisting on mobile devices has been resolved. Now, when selecting an answer and progressing to the next question on mobile devices, the hover appearance of the answer buttons is correctly removed, providing a consistent user experience.

## Automated Testing

### HTML
To test the markup validity [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used.
The following warning/errors were identified:
**Possible Misuse of Aria-label:** The aria-label attribute was originally attached to a div element, which is not considered an interactive element and therefore cannot have aria-label attributes.

To resolve this issue and ensure compliance with accessibility standards, the div element was replaced with a button element. Buttons are interactive elements and are suitable for adding aria-label attributes.

By making this adjustment, the HTML code now adheres to accessibility guidelines and passes validation without errors.


### CSS
A [CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to check the validity of the CSS code of the quiz. There were no errors detected.

### JavaScript
A [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check the validity of the JavaScript code of the quiz. There were no errors detected.

Metrics:
There are 25 functions in this file.
Function with the largest signature take 1 arguments, while the median is 0.
Largest function has 28 statements in it, while the median is 5.
The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 9 while the median is 1.

### Light House Analysis
Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was used to assess the performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO rating of the website. 

The Lighthouse analysis was run on both mobile and desktop devices and the results are illustrated below:
