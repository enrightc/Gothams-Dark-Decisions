            <p>You awaken in a dimly lit alley, surrounded by towering buildings that cast long shadows. Your head throbs with pain, and you realise you have no memory of who you are or how you ended up here.

This encounter marks the beginning of your journey to uncover your true identity in the heart of Gotham City.</p>
